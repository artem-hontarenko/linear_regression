Linear Regression

The proposal for the project is to implement multivariate linear regression model. The training of the model will be performed using gradient descent. The implementation will include core numerical operations such as vector arithmetic, dot products, and gradient computation, all defined functionally without relying on external libraries for linear algebra. In addition to model training and prediction, the project will provide basic evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).
